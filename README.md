## Development

### Setting up Telegram Bot

Before using this application in Telegram, you need to create a Telegram Bot and Mini App. Follow the [comprehensive guide](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/platform/creating-new-app) for detailed instructions.

### Running the Application

The application can be run both inside and outside of Telegram during development:

#### HTTPS Development (Recommended)

For full Telegram Mini App functionality, use HTTPS:

```bash
npm run dev:https
```

> **Note**: On first run, you may be prompted for administrator password to install SSL certificates via [vite-plugin-mkcert](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-mkcert).

#### HTTP Development

For basic development without SSL:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Accessing the Application

After starting the development server, you'll see output similar to:

```bash
VITE v6.2.4 ready in 237 ms

âžœ  Local:   https://localhost:5173/
âžœ  Network: https://192.168.1.100:5173/
```

- **Local**: Access from your development machine
- **Network**: Access from other devices on the same network (useful for mobile testing)

### Development Environment

The application includes a mock Telegram environment (`src/mockEnv.ts`) that allows development outside of Telegram. This simulates the Telegram SDK functionality for development purposes.

> **Warning**: The mock environment should not be used in production. It's automatically disabled when the app runs inside actual Telegram clients.

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages, which provides fast CDN delivery. You can also deploy to other platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

### GitHub Pages Deployment

#### Configuration

Before deploying, ensure the following configuration is correct:

1. **package.json**: Update the `homepage` field to match your GitHub Pages URL:
```json
{
  "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name"
}
```

2. **vite.config.ts**: Set the `base` field to your repository name:
```ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/repository-name/',
  // ...
});
```

#### Manual Deployment

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

#### Automatic Deployment

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys when changes are pushed to the `master` branch.

To enable automatic deployment:

1. Go to your repository settings: `https://github.com/username/repository/settings/environments`
2. Create or edit the `github-pages` environment
3. Add `master` to the deployment branches list
